# Maat

A bright, mobile app prototype for prediction-market Agent execution and liquidity services. Open it on a phone for the app experience, or on a computer for a phone preview and screen board.

Live preview: https://timi-public.github.io/maat-app/

Screen board: https://timi-public.github.io/maat-app/review.html

## Run locally

Node.js 22 or newer. No dependencies or install step.

```sh
npm run dev
npm run check
npm run build
```

The dev server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:4186`. The build produces a static `dist/` directory. GitHub Actions deploys that directory to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`.

## Screens

- Overview, Agent Trading, Liquidity Marketplace, Tokenomics, Portfolio and Swap.
- Agent overview, public trade feed, five Agent lifecycle states, and planned analysis / monitoring tabs. The Portfolio tab is the funding entry; More is in the top bar.
- Market categories, topics, search, three-card pagination, service requests and service details.
- Whitepaper draft, guide, data sources and screen board (`review.html`).
- Account activity: five latest entries, a full history screen, type/time filters, search, pagination and a horizontally scrollable table.

## Interactions

Prepare demo USDC, choose a participation mode, inspect run/exit/resume/stopped states, create a demo liquidity request, filter public trades, inspect historical token prices, simulate two-way swaps with a 5% token tax, deposit MAAT into the project balance, and edit a local profile. Language choices remain visible for two seconds after selection; appearance defaults to Auto by device local time.

## Data boundaries

This is an interface preview. Wallet connection (Leo PRD 11-10 §2.4): inside a wallet app it connects automatically; elsewhere users pick a popular wallet (desktop extension, or a deep link on phones) or use the test wallet. Only the address and network are read; a non-Polygon network gets a switch prompt. It never requests signatures, approves tokens or moves funds. Prototype parts: the test wallet signs in with a local demo address so the signed-in pages can be reviewed without a wallet (WalletConnect is left for the real build), and the referrer confirmation (§3) signs nothing and is stored on this device. All pages and demo actions work as a guest. Accounts, balances, P&L, telemetry, services and swap quotes are labelled demonstrations.

Wallet activity is separate from the demo product ledger. No Polygon history provider is configured: address queries show an unavailable state and a PolygonScan link. Explicit layout samples can be opened with `?activity=preview#account/activity`; they are labelled samples and have no invented transaction links. A read-only `window.ForeaActivityProvider.list({address, chainId:137, cursor})` adapter is the integration boundary for a future history service.

Public market titles, probabilities, liquidity, volume, order books and transactions come from a timestamped Polymarket snapshot. Counts and volume totals refer only to selected samples, not the entire platform. Market images are retained locally. See `data/sources.json` for endpoints and field scope.

Some product details are intentionally marked as planned or proposed. The illustrative 4% liquidity fee is paid by the user; it is not a promised yield.

Visual direction: from 2026-11-09 the approved design is a dark theme with blue gradient actions and a new M mark; it is being restored into this code (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)). Until then the code still shows the earlier bright white/gray-and-green look. Maat has its own brand and is not presented as a Polymarket product.
